Pygame version of the "Chrome Dino Runner Game"

'Dino Run - Alternate Dimensions'

In this game, there is a dinosaur that has to tackle and dodge the obstacles that will come towards it. The dinosaur will move horizontally on the ground.

Initially, only the cactus will come towards the dino. It has to tackle the cactuses by jumping over them. If it touches any of them, then the game gets over. If the player manages to survive this initial stage then, birds will also start coming towards the dino.

The dino has to dodge the birds by ducking below them. The cactus will not stop coming and will continue to come along with the birds.

The main objective of the player is to tackle as many obstacles ( cactus and birds) as possible. 
The game will end when the dino touches any of the obstacles i.e cactus or bird.
The game is similiar tothe chrome version of dino game.
